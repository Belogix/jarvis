My implementation of Iron man's faithful personal assistant.

To get started create an `.env` file with contents similar to:
```
openai_key = "Your Open AI API key"
the_boss = "Your name"
```

To install all required Python packages run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```

This is a work in progress, check back soon!
